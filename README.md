  <summary><strong>Pair / Sync Kärcher / Karcher K5 Full Control Pressure Washer trigger gun with the machine.</strong></summary>
  
If your Karcher K5 waterblaster trigger gun isn't synched with the main unit, then the display won't work and you won't be able to change pressure or use the detergent dispenser.

I found the following instructions in a comment on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41KwJPW4btY

### Please follow the below instructions:

1. Set up the pressure washer and turn on
2. Once machine is pressurised,  hold both the + and – buttons  down on the gun
3. flashing symbol will appear at the top of the display and the screen should show 3 separate symbols
4. Your machine and gun should now be ready to use 

In the unlikely event this does not work:

1. Turn the machine off at the mains 
2. Hold the + and – buttons down again until the screen flashes 
3. Plug the machine back in 
4. Your machine and gun should now be ready to use
  
I also found "Pairing Full Control Plus" on https://www.kaercher.com/uk/home-garden/how-to-guides/pressure-washers/pairing-full-control-plus.html
